# Coursera_Capstone
Suppose I received two job offers, one at Manhattan and one at Old (Downtown) Toronto. Regardless of the job opportunities I want to consider which is the best place for me to move at. My main concerns are how busy these places are, and which one has many good options of coffee shops, restaurants, and bars. These are the features I am going to compare to make my decision.
The data I am going to use is the one provided from the Coursera courses for both cities. I am going to work only with these two boroughs as they are the busiest boroughs of their cities.
